# Error list

GCop code | Description
--- | ---
101 | [Too many parameters as argument. Define a container and encapsulate them](/Rules/GCop101.md)
103 | [Instead of null, return an empty collection such as Enumerable.Empty<method.ReturnType>](/Rules/GCop103.md)

114 | [DateTime.Now is not TDD friendly. Use LocalTime.Now instead.](/Rules/GCop114.md)
116 | [Break this down into smaller methods. If such methods would become meaningless as standalone methods in the context of the class, you can refactor this method into a Stateful Service class](/Rules/GCop116.md)
117 | [The meaning of **true / false** is not obvious. Specify the parameter's name explicitly.](/Rules/GCop117.md)
119 | [Don’t use **ref / out** parameters in method definition. To return several objects, define a class or struct for your method return type.](/Rules/GCop119.md)

201 | [Use camelCasing when declaring local variables / a parameter.](/Rules/GCop201.md)
202 | [Don’t end the name of **methods** with the same name as the **class**](/Rules/GCop202.md)
204 | [Rename the variable 'variable name' to something clear and meaningful.](/Rules/GCop204.md)
206 | [Avoid using underscores in the class name](/Rules/GCop206.md)

209 | [Use PascalCasing for (class or enum or ... ) names.](/Rules/GCop209.md)
210 | [Suffix the name of a service class with 'Service' as it's inside the Services folder.](/Rules/GCop210.md)
214 | [The variable defined to return the result of the method should be named **result**](/Rules/GCop214.md)

314 | [You don't need the Where clause. Replace with FirstOrDefault(LambdaExpression)](/Rules/GCop314.md)
317 | [This code is repeated 'repeatation count' times in this method. If its value remains the same during the method execution, store it in a variable. Otherwise define a method (or Func<T> variable) instead of repeating the expression. 'expression type'](/Rules/GCop317.md)
318 | [This will cause the query to be computed multiple times. Instead call .ToList() on the variable declaration line to avoid unwanted extra processing.](/Rules/GCop318.md)

402 | [Remove unnecessary parenthesis.](/Rules/GCop402.md)
408 | [Flag or switch parameters (bool) should go after all non-optional parameters. If the boolean parameter is not a flag or switch, split the method into two different methods, each doing one thing.](/Rules/GCop408.md)

529 | [Use 'IEnumerable< MyClassObject >' instead.](/Rules/GCop529.md)
538 | [File extensions can have different casing. Use case insensitive string comparison.](/Rules/GCop538.md)
539 | [Don't hard-code URLs in the code as they might be subject to change. Use Config.Get(...) instead.](/Rules/GCop539.md)

607 | [It should be written as Enumerable.Except< TSource >](/Rules/GCop607.md)
614 | [Random instance should be defined and instantiated as a static class field.](/Rules/GCop614.md)
615 | [Negative logical comparisons are taxing on the brain. Instead of "!object.Any()" use "object.None()".](/Rules/GCop615.md)
616 | [Reverse your IF criteria and use 'continue'. That will eliminate the need for a big IF block and make the code more readable.](/Rules/GCop616.md)
620 | [To simplify the condition use the "??".](/Rules/GCop620.md)
622 | [Reverse your IF condition and return. Then move the nested statements to after the IF.](/Rules/GCop622.md)
634 | [Instead of private property, use a class field.](/Rules/GCop634.md)
635 | [The condition of the where clause is very long and should be turned into a method.](/Rules/GCop635.md)
638 | [Shorten this method by defining it as expression-bodied.](/Rules/GCop638.md)

648 | [Use stringPhrase.Remove(oldValue) instead](/Rules/GCop648.md)
651 | [Wait() method can cause a deadlock. Use the await keyword on the method call instead.](/Rules/GCop651.md)
