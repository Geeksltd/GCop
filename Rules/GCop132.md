> *"Since the type is inferred, use 'var' instead"*


## Rule description
The potential benefit of using var instead of type is in readability and brevity. When the type of the variable is clear on the right side of the assignment (e.g. via a cast or a constructor call), there is no benefit of also having it on the left side.

There is one exception which is where the type is a delegate type such as Action or Func.
 

## Example 1
```csharp
public void MyMethod()
{
    object myObject = new object();
    ...
}
```
*should be* ðŸ¡»

```csharp
public void MyMethod()
{
    var myObject = new object();
    ...
}
```
 

## Example 2
```csharp
public void MyMethod()
{
    Dictionary<int, MyLongNamedObject> dictionary = new Dictionary<int, MyLongNamedObject>();
}
```
*should be* ðŸ¡»

```csharp
public void MyMethod()
{
    var dictionary = new Dictionary<int, MyLongNamedObject>();
}
```
