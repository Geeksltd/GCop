> *"Random instance should be defined and instantiated as a static class field."*

## Rule description

Every time new `Random()` is called, it is initialized using the clock. This means that in a tight loop it returns same value lots of times. So keep a single Random instance and keep using Next on the same instance is a best practice.

## Example

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    void MyMethod()
    {
        var rnd = new Random();
        rnd.Next(1,100);
    }
}
```

*should be* ðŸ¡»

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    static Random Random = new Random();
    void MyMethod()
    {
        Random.Next(1,100);
    }
}
```
