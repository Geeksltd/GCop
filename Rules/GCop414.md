> *"Remove .ToString() as it's unnecessary."*


## Rule description

String.ToString Method() Returns this instance of String; no actual conversion is performed.
Because this method simply returns the current string unchanged, there is no need to call it.  
also You'll get a Null Reference Exception if your string is NULL and you use .ToString();


## Example 1
**Violating code:**
```csharp
var result = "someText" + myObject.ToString() + " ...";
```

**Compliant code**

```
 
## Example 2
**Violating code:**
```csharp

```
