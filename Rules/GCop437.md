# GCop 437

> *"Complete the task associated to this `TODO` comment."*

## Rule description

When in development, often you need to add a reminder to complete a task. We track them in Visual Studio with `TODO` comments. These comments help organize our projects.

GCop will show a central list of those in the Messages window to help you remember and address them.
