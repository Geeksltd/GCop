> *"Variable declaration is unnecessary due to it being used only for return statement"*

## Rule description

It is a bad practice to declare a variable only to immediately return or throw. This variable is an internal implementation detail that is not exposed to the callers of the method so it does not improve code readability.

## Example

```csharp
public int MyMethod(int myParam)
{
    var amount = myParam * 200;
    return amount;  
}
```

*should be* ðŸ¡»

```csharp
public int MyMethod(int myParam)
{
    return myParam * 200; 
}
```
*which, in this case, allows it to get even shorter* ðŸ¡»
```csharp
public int MyMethod(int myParam)=> myParam * 200; 
```
